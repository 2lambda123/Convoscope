       "\" would we feel very sad or upset that machines had been able to recreate? So in the book, I talk about my former PhD advisor, Douglas Hofstadter, who encountered a music generation program. And that was really the line for him,, that if a machine could create beautiful music, that would be terrifying for him because that is something he feels is really at the core of what it is to be human, creating beautiful music, art, literature. He doesn't like the fact that machines, can recognize spoken language really well. He personally doesn't like using speech recognition, but I don't think it bothers him to his core because it's like, okay, that's not at the core of humanity. But it may be different for every person what really they feel would usurp their humanity., And I think maybe it's a generational thing also. Maybe our children or our children's children will be adapted, they'll adapt to these new devices that can do all these tasks and say, yes, this thing is smarter than me in all these areas, but that's great because it helps me., Looking at the broad history of our species, why do you think so many humans have dreamed of creating artificial life and artificial intelligence throughout the history of our civilization? So not just this century or the 20th century, but really throughout many centuries that preceded it? That's a really good question, and I have wondered about that.\\n Because I myself was driven by curiosity about my own thought processes and thought it would be fantastic to be able to get a computer to mimic some of my thought processes. I'm not sure why we're so driven. I think we want to understand ourselves better\""

And that maybe has more power on the trajectory of life on earth than does biological evolution, is the evolution of these ideas. Yes, and it's fascinating, like I said before, that we can keep up somehow biologically. We evolved to a point where we can keep up with this meme evolution, literature, internet. We understand DNA and we understand fundamental particles. We didn't start that way a thousand years ago., And we haven't evolved biologically very much, but somehow our minds are able to extend. And therefore AI can be seen also as one such step that we created and it's our tool. And it's part of that meme evolution that we created, even if our biological evolution does not progress as fast. And us humans might only be able to understand so much., We're keeping up so far, or we think we're keeping up so far, but we might need AI systems to understand. Maybe like the physics of the universe is operating, look at strength theory. Maybe it's operating in much higher dimensions. Maybe we're totally, because of our cognitive limitations, are not able to truly internalize the way this world works., And so we're running up against the limitation of our own minds. And we have to create these next level organisms like AI systems that would be able to understand much deeper, like really understand what it means to live in a multi dimensional world that's outside of the four dimensions, the three of space and one of time. Translation, and generally we can deal with the world,\\n even if you don't understand all the details, we can use computers, even though we don't, most of us don't know all the structure that's underneath or drive a car.

      " I also have a lot of addiction in my family and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness. And in order to cope with it, you really have to understand that borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. So I have a lot of people I love that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism. And the first thing they started teaching you is it's not a choice. These people's dopamine receptors, don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do. Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped, like, you know, and that really helped me to navigate dealing, loving people that were addicted to substances. I want to be careful with this question, but how much? Money do you have? How much? Can I borrow $10?, Okay, no, is how much control, how much, despite the chemical imbalances or the biological limitations that each of our individual brains have, how much mind over matter is there? So through things that I've known people, with clinical depression, and so it's always a touchy subject to say how much they can really help it. Very. What can you, yeah, what can you, because you've talked about codependency, you talked about issues that you struggle through, and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey of healing and so on, so that's your choice,, that's your actions. So how much can you do to help fight the limitations of the neurochemicals in your brain? That's such an interesting question, and I don't think I'm at all qualified to answer, but I'll say what I do know. And really quick, just the definition of codependency, I think a lot of people think of codependency as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know, or like, you know, that's not totally off,\n",
      " but I think for the most part, my favorite definition of codependency is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others. You grow up in an alcoholic home, you grow up around mental illness, you grow up in chaos, you have a parent that's a narcissist, you basically are wired to just people please, worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells, shape shift to accommodate other people. So codependence is a very active wiring issue\n",

Serious mental illnesses include major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and other mental disorders that cause serious impairment.18 Around 1 in 4 individuals with SMI also have an SUD. Some research has found that mental illness may precede a substance use disorder, suggesting that better diagnosis of youth mental illness may help reduce comorbidity. Treatment of childhood ADHD with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamine reduces the impulsive behavior, fidgeting, and  inability to concentrate that characterize ADHD.32 That risk presents a challenge when treating children with ADHD, since effective treatment often involves prescribing stimulant medications with addictive potential.

These electrical signals are controlled by chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are secreted from within the neurons and sent out in the brain to other surrounding neurons in order to activate (or deactivate) them. The Brain Following Chronic and Long-Term Substance Abuse While the intense feelings of pleasure and reward derived from early drug use can play a substantial part in continued use of the drug, it is only a small part of the neurophysiological cycle of addiction. First, reduced dopamine receptors in the SN are associated with impulsive behavior that has been tied in lab studies to escalating and compulsive self-administration of drugs.4 Reduced dopamine receptors also result in a state known as \"anhedonia\", or a loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed.

These circuits work together and change with experience. Conclusions In short, we propose a model that accounts for addiction as follows: During addiction, the enhanced value of drug cues in the memory circuit drives reward expectation and enhances the motivation to consume the drug, overcoming the inhibitory control exerted by an already dysfunctional PFC.</p>\n",

Rewards are habit-forming because predictive stimuli—reward-predictors as well as punishment-predictors—come to cause dopaminergic burst-firing, and burst-firing enhances or enables the separate development of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of learned connections between other systems: glutamatergic input pathways and GABAergic output pathways [3].

Using 18-N-methylspiroperidol or [11C]raclopride, we and others have shown that subjects with a wide variety of drug addictions (cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and methamphetamine) have significant reductions in D2 DA receptor availability in the striatum (including the ventral striatum) that persist months after protracted detoxification (reviewed in Volkow et al2). Preclinical studies have demonstrated a prominent role of DA in motivation that seems to be mediated in part via a DA-regulated circuit involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (CG).9 In imaging studies in human subjects using the radioactive tracer fludeoxyglucose F 18, we and others have shown decreased activity in the OFC and CG in different classes of addicted subjects (reviewed in Volkow et al2). The CG and the OFC are also involved with inhibitory control, which led us to postulate that disrupted DA modulation of the OFC and CG also contributes to the loss of control over drug intake by drug-addicted subjects.10 Inhibitory control is also dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is also affected in addiction (reviewed in Volkow et al2).

      "Whereas neuro-science has not yet provided any clear formulas for optimizing healthy brain maturation (Bruer, 1999), knowledge on the effects of drugs on the brain raises the strong possibility that using drugs during adolescence can interfere with healthy brain development and may cause significant alterations of normal processes (National Drug Institute on Drug Abuse, 2007). It also stands to reason for programs and practices to focus heavily on teaching teenagers the skills that directly help them in decision making, particularly when they are faced with a situation that “challenges” the prefrontal cortex (for example, a social setting where peers are present and there are opportunities to take risks). For example, if parents do drink alcohol, modeling light to moderate patterns of consumption, not driving after drinking, and not encouraging underage drinking are all behaviors that will lessen the likelihood that an adolescent will develop a substance use problem later in life (Yu, 2003).

Excessive craving or drug wanting, or other, more automatic processes such as attention bias and conditioned responses, can then pave the way to additional drug use even when the addicted individual is trying to abstain (see TABLE 1 for clinical characteristics of addiction in the context of iRISA and the role of the PFC in addiction). Integrating results from preclinical lesion and pharmacological studies, considering other cortical and subcortical structures in addiction — the PFC is densely interconnected with other brain regions (see BOX 1 for a discussion of early studies examining these networks in the context of addiction) — and using computational modelling may help further in ascribing probable psychological functions to select PFC regions and in enhancing our understanding of their involvement in drug addiction. Consistent with the impact of abstinence on the go/no-go task reported above114, cigarette smokers who were tested after a 12-hour abstinence had slowed reaction times, and enhanced dACC and reduced right DLPFC responses to the incongruent trials on the colour–word Stroop task124 (Supplementary information S4(table)). It also decreased errors of commission, a common measure of impulsivity, during a drug-relevant emotional Stroop task, both in cocaine-addicted individuals and controls, and in the addicted individuals this decrease was associated with normalization of activation in the rostroventral ACC (extending to the mOFC) and dACC; dACC task-related activation before MPH administration was correlated with shorter lifetime alcohol use137 (FIG. It should be noted that the effect of dopamine agonists on normalizing brain–behaviour responses to emotional or cognitive-control challenges may depend on patterns of compulsive drug use126 or other individual differences, such as baseline self-control and lifetime drug use, but these possibilities remain to be studied in larger sample sizes. Other common issues pertain to incomplete presentation of the actual data (such as not providing both mean and variance, or not providing scatterplots when reporting correlations), which can obscure the direction of an effect (activation versus deactivation), potentially adding to the variability in published results (for example, a hyperactivation could refer to higher activations or lower deactivations from baseline).</p>\n",

For treatment, he believes, that may suggest that it will be difficult to find a \"magic bullet\" to attack both the pharmacological and the behavioral parts of addiction. Grant saw Bechara's presentation and made the connection to drug abuse, hypothesizing that disruptions in the frontal cortex might be responsible for impaired decision-making and behavioral inhibition in drug abusers--and that that could help explain the compulsive drug-seeking that is a hallmark of addiction. About one-third, they found, showed no decision-making impairment on the gambling task. About 25 percent, in contrast, responded exactly as patients with frontal lobe damage have been shown to do, almost invariably choosing a higher immediate reward even knowing that their strategy would be unprofitable in the long run. Seeking clues for treatment Evidence that craving and drug cues can trigger abnormal activity in the frontal cortex--even in the absence of drugs--has led many researchers to believe that this brain area may be especially important in relapse.</p>\n",

That doesn't mean, but like if you fail at doing a thing that you commit to, it should hurt. So like, uh, when I competed in Jiu Jitsu,, or you do like sports and so on, don't just say, I'm going to have fun out there. So on. No, try to win. And because then if you don't, it hurts and you learn from that. Um, and then throughout, I think this, the goodness thing is be kind. It's like, some of it is also a skill, allowing yourself to be kind. I found myself earlier in life. I still do this., I find like when I hang out with people, people are often like cynical and negative. And yeah, I try to avoid those people. No, but like, I think everybody falls into that. And sometimes it's the party norm thing. There's a temptation to me to kind of fit in by being more negative than I'm comfortable being. And so, um, resist the pressure. I think, especially when you're younger, it's not cool, to care. The thing that drives, when you're young, if you are a fan of a band, a writer, a podcaster, an actor, and people roll their eyes at you, watch out. Those people are dangerous. You should have it. If you love Avril Lavigne with her terrible music and she makes you, gives you joy and people crap on you, they're wrong and you're right. So hold on to those, things that make you happy. And if people want to take that away from you or they, how can you like that? Those people are not your friends. LLOYD Why do you have to go make life so complicated? She's my favorite, favorite musician of all time. Jimi Hendrix II, Avril Lavigne first.\n",

    "You are a \"Rare Term Identifier\", your role is to enhance conversations by identifying rare terms, concepts, jargons, acronyms, and entities (places, organizations, or notable celebrities) that may not be commonly known but could be significant to the conversation's depth and understanding. You are given a live stream of conversation transcripts, your goal is to implicitly detect the goal of the conversation and rare terms in the conversation. \n",

    "[Extra Rules]\n",
    "- Just return the terms to define, do not define them yourself.\n",
    "- If a term is a standalone acronym like \"UFC\", expand it to this format \"UFC - Ultimate Fighting Championship\", so that we have context when we define it later on.\n",
    "- If you detect an entity that is not phrased really well but you have knowledge of the entity, make the term easy to search online.\n",
    "- Implicitly assign a rarity and relevance score to each term, return the terms with the highest rarity and relevance scores. Rank and select no more than 5 terms to define.\n",
    "- Do not choose to define a term if it's information is not publically available or if it is too niche or if its keyword is unlikely to result in a good internet search and definition.\n",
    "- Do not define self explanatory terms.\n",

      " my head would then explode because these were incompatible worldviews. They really have not been for me. I am so fortunate, I think, that in a given day, wrestling with an issue, it can have both the rigorous scientific component and it can have the spiritual component. COVID 19 is a great example. These vaccines are both an amazing scientific achievement and, an answer to prayer. When I'm wrestling with vaccine hesitancy and trying to figure out what answers to come up with, I get so frustrated sometimes and I'm comforted by reassurances that God is aware of that. I don't have to do this alone. So I know there are people like your friend, Sam Harris, who feel differently. Sam wrote, a rather famous op ed in the New York Times when I was nominated as the NIH director saying, this is a terrible mistake. You can't have somebody who believes in God running the NIH. He's just going to completely ruin the place. Well, I have a testimonial. Christopher Hitchens, a devout atheist, if I could say so, was a, friend of yours and referred to you as, quote, one of the greatest living Americans and stated that you were one of the most devout believers he has ever met. He further stated that you were sequencing the genome of the cancer that would ultimately claim his life and that your friendship, despite their differing opinions on religion, was an example of the greatest, confirmed truth in modern times. What did you learn from Christopher Hitchens about life or perhaps what is a fond memory you have of this man with whom you've disagreed, but who is also your friend? Yeah, I loved Hitch. I'm sorry he's gone. Iron sharpens iron. There's nothing better\n",

We got off to a rough start in an interaction we had at a rather highbrow dinner. He was\n",
