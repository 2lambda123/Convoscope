Number two, Russia is much more divided than people know. There's other factors in Russia. There are always tensions around the Kremlin, who has power, who doesn't have power., That's been going on for 100 years. But the factions in Russia are very much there. So when people refer to Russia as Putin, they're mistaken. And they do this regularly in the New York papers and all this. They say, Putin did this, Putin did that, Putin's doing that, but it's Russia that's doing it., And that's what, there's a distinction there that I, it's changed. In the old days, I would read about Khrushchev, but it was never Khrushchev personally. It was about the Soviet Union. There was respect for a country. And now when it started to get personal with Putin, it changed and our thinking changed in a negative way., We no longer respected it as a country, we were seeing it as a man. And the man we had trashed repeatedly, repeatedly as a poisoner, as a murderer, and none of which has ever been proven, but which has always been repeated and repeated to the point at which it becomes like an Orwell mantra. It becomes like, he is of course a bad guy. Can I just ask you, as a great filmmaker,, as a human being, what was it like talking to one of the most powerful men in the world? For honestly, and I'm not naive, I've talked to a lot of powerful people. In the movie business, there are powerful people and many of them are corrupted. I've talked to many people in my life. I've been in the military, I've seen, I've had other jobs. I have to say, I found him to be a human being.\\n I just found him to be reasonable, calm. I never saw him lose his temper. And I mean, you have to understand that most people, most people in the Western way of doing business get emotional. I don't see that. I saw him as a balanced man, as a man who had studied this like you have. There's a calmness to you. It comes from studying the world\""

And that maybe has more power on the trajectory of life on earth than does biological evolution, is the evolution of these ideas. Yes, and it's fascinating, like I said before, that we can keep up somehow biologically. We evolved to a point where we can keep up with this meme evolution, literature, internet. We understand DNA and we understand fundamental particles. We didn't start that way a thousand years ago., And we haven't evolved biologically very much, but somehow our minds are able to extend. And therefore AI can be seen also as one such step that we created and it's our tool. And it's part of that meme evolution that we created, even if our biological evolution does not progress as fast. And us humans might only be able to understand so much., We're keeping up so far, or we think we're keeping up so far, but we might need AI systems to understand. Maybe like the physics of the universe is operating, look at strength theory. Maybe it's operating in much higher dimensions. Maybe we're totally, because of our cognitive limitations, are not able to truly internalize the way this world works., And so we're running up against the limitation of our own minds. And we have to create these next level organisms like AI systems that would be able to understand much deeper, like really understand what it means to live in a multi dimensional world that's outside of the four dimensions, the three of space and one of time. Translation, and generally we can deal with the world,\\n even if you don't understand all the details, we can use computers, even though we don't, most of us don't know all the structure that's underneath or drive a car. I mean, there are many components, especially new cars that you don't quite fully know, but you have the interface, you have an abstraction of it that allows you to operate it and utilize it.

      " I also have a lot of addiction in my family and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness. And in order to cope with it, you really have to understand that borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. So I have a lot of people I love that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism. And the first thing they started teaching you is it's not a choice. These people's dopamine receptors, don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do. Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped, like, you know, and that really helped me to navigate dealing, loving people that were addicted to substances. I want to be careful with this question, but how much? Money do you have? How much? Can I borrow $10?, Okay, no, is how much control, how much, despite the chemical imbalances or the biological limitations that each of our individual brains have, how much mind over matter is there? So through things that I've known people, with clinical depression, and so it's always a touchy subject to say how much they can really help it. Very. What can you, yeah, what can you, because you've talked about codependency, you talked about issues that you struggle through, and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey of healing and so on, so that's your choice,, that's your actions. So how much can you do to help fight the limitations of the neurochemicals in your brain? That's such an interesting question, and I don't think I'm at all qualified to answer, but I'll say what I do know. And really quick, just the definition of codependency, I think a lot of people think of codependency as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know, or like, you know, that's not totally off,\n",
      " but I think for the most part, my favorite definition of codependency is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others. You grow up in an alcoholic home, you grow up around mental illness, you grow up in chaos, you have a parent that's a narcissist, you basically are wired to just people please, worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells, shape shift to accommodate other people. So codependence is a very active wiring issue\n",

Serious mental illnesses include major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and other mental disorders that cause serious impairment.18 Around 1 in 4 individuals with SMI also have an SUD. Some research has found that mental illness may precede a substance use disorder, suggesting that better diagnosis of youth mental illness may help reduce comorbidity. Treatment of childhood ADHD with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamine reduces the impulsive behavior, fidgeting, and  inability to concentrate that characterize ADHD.32 That risk presents a challenge when treating children with ADHD, since effective treatment often involves prescribing stimulant medications with addictive potential.

      " Our Locations The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation has addiction and mental health facilities in 8 States throughout the United States. What makes certain substances so addictive? These electrical signals are controlled by chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are secreted from within the neurons and sent out in the brain to other surrounding neurons in order to activate (or deactivate) them. The Brain Following Chronic and Long-Term Substance Abuse While the intense feelings of pleasure and reward derived from early drug use can play a substantial part in continued use of the drug, it is only a small part of the neurophysiological cycle of addiction. First, reduced dopamine receptors in the SN are associated with impulsive behavior that has been tied in lab studies to escalating and compulsive self-administration of drugs.4 Reduced dopamine receptors also result in a state known as \"anhedonia\", or a loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed.

These circuits work together and change with experience. Conclusions In short, we propose a model that accounts for addiction as follows: During addiction, the enhanced value of drug cues in the memory circuit drives reward expectation and enhances the motivation to consume the drug, overcoming the inhibitory control exerted by an already dysfunctional PFC.</p>\n",

Rewards are habit-forming because predictive stimuli—reward-predictors as well as punishment-predictors—come to cause dopaminergic burst-firing, and burst-firing enhances or enables the separate development of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of learned connections between other systems: glutamatergic input pathways and GABAergic output pathways [3].

Using 18-N-methylspiroperidol or [11C]raclopride, we and others have shown that subjects with a wide variety of drug addictions (cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and methamphetamine) have significant reductions in D2 DA receptor availability in the striatum (including the ventral striatum) that persist months after protracted detoxification (reviewed in Volkow et al2). Preclinical studies have demonstrated a prominent role of DA in motivation that seems to be mediated in part via a DA-regulated circuit involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (CG).9 In imaging studies in human subjects using the radioactive tracer fludeoxyglucose F 18, we and others have shown decreased activity in the OFC and CG in different classes of addicted subjects (reviewed in Volkow et al2). The CG and the OFC are also involved with inhibitory control, which led us to postulate that disrupted DA modulation of the OFC and CG also contributes to the loss of control over drug intake by drug-addicted subjects.10 Inhibitory control is also dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is also affected in addiction (reviewed in Volkow et al2).

      "Whereas neuro-science has not yet provided any clear formulas for optimizing healthy brain maturation (Bruer, 1999), knowledge on the effects of drugs on the brain raises the strong possibility that using drugs during adolescence can interfere with healthy brain development and may cause significant alterations of normal processes (National Drug Institute on Drug Abuse, 2007). It also stands to reason for programs and practices to focus heavily on teaching teenagers the skills that directly help them in decision making, particularly when they are faced with a situation that “challenges” the prefrontal cortex (for example, a social setting where peers are present and there are opportunities to take risks). For example, if parents do drink alcohol, modeling light to moderate patterns of consumption, not driving after drinking, and not encouraging underage drinking are all behaviors that will lessen the likelihood that an adolescent will develop a substance use problem later in life (Yu, 2003).

Excessive craving or drug wanting, or other, more automatic processes such as attention bias and conditioned responses, can then pave the way to additional drug use even when the addicted individual is trying to abstain (see TABLE 1 for clinical characteristics of addiction in the context of iRISA and the role of the PFC in addiction). Integrating results from preclinical lesion and pharmacological studies, considering other cortical and subcortical structures in addiction — the PFC is densely interconnected with other brain regions (see BOX 1 for a discussion of early studies examining these networks in the context of addiction) — and using computational modelling may help further in ascribing probable psychological functions to select PFC regions and in enhancing our understanding of their involvement in drug addiction. Consistent with the impact of abstinence on the go/no-go task reported above114, cigarette smokers who were tested after a 12-hour abstinence had slowed reaction times, and enhanced dACC and reduced right DLPFC responses to the incongruent trials on the colour–word Stroop task124 (Supplementary information S4(table)). It also decreased errors of commission, a common measure of impulsivity, during a drug-relevant emotional Stroop task, both in cocaine-addicted individuals and controls, and in the addicted individuals this decrease was associated with normalization of activation in the rostroventral ACC (extending to the mOFC) and dACC; dACC task-related activation before MPH administration was correlated with shorter lifetime alcohol use137 (FIG. It should be noted that the effect of dopamine agonists on normalizing brain–behaviour responses to emotional or cognitive-control challenges may depend on patterns of compulsive drug use126 or other individual differences, such as baseline self-control and lifetime drug use, but these possibilities remain to be studied in larger sample sizes. Other common issues pertain to incomplete presentation of the actual data (such as not providing both mean and variance, or not providing scatterplots when reporting correlations), which can obscure the direction of an effect (activation versus deactivation), potentially adding to the variability in published results (for example, a hyperactivation could refer to higher activations or lower deactivations from baseline).</p>\n",

For treatment, he believes, that may suggest that it will be difficult to find a \"magic bullet\" to attack both the pharmacological and the behavioral parts of addiction. Grant saw Bechara's presentation and made the connection to drug abuse, hypothesizing that disruptions in the frontal cortex might be responsible for impaired decision-making and behavioral inhibition in drug abusers--and that that could help explain the compulsive drug-seeking that is a hallmark of addiction. About one-third, they found, showed no decision-making impairment on the gambling task. About 25 percent, in contrast, responded exactly as patients with frontal lobe damage have been shown to do, almost invariably choosing a higher immediate reward even knowing that their strategy would be unprofitable in the long run. Seeking clues for treatment Evidence that craving and drug cues can trigger abnormal activity in the frontal cortex--even in the absence of drugs--has led many researchers to believe that this brain area may be especially important in relapse.</p>\n",

In addition, more than 400 million people (6%) practice various folk or traditional religions, including African traditional religions, Chinese folk religions, Native American religions and Australian aboriginal religions. Though by smaller margins, most Muslims (73%) and religiously unaffiliated people (71%) also live in countries in which they are the predominant religious group. The study is based on a country-by-country analysis of data from more than 2,500 national censuses, large-scale surveys and official population registers that were collected, evaluated and standardized by the Pew Forum’s demographers and other research staff.4 Many countries have recently conducted a national census or are in the midst of doing so. For details on the methodology used to produce estimates of religious populations in 232 countries and territories, see Appendix A. For a list of data sources by country, see Appendix B. To see each country’s and territory’s population broken down by number and percentage into the eight major religious groups in the study, see the sortable tables at http://features.pewresearch.org/religion/grl/population-number.php. For example, various surveys have found that belief in God or a higher power is shared by 7% of unaffiliated Chinese adults, 30% of unaffiliated French adults and 68% of unaffiliated U.S. adults.6 Other Religions The “other religions” category is diverse and comprises groups not classified elsewhere. Because of the lack of data on these faiths in many countries, the Pew Forum has not attempted to estimate the size of individual religions within this category, though some rough estimates are available from other sources.

For this report, we used data from a survey conducted across 34 countries from May 13 to Oct. 2, 2019, totaling 38,426 respondents. Despite variances in religious observance, a median of 62% across the countries surveyed say that religion plays an important role in their lives, while 61% agree that God plays an important role in their lives and 53% say the same about prayer. Aside from Russia, only two other countries – Bulgaria and Japan – have seen significant increases in the share of their publics who hold this opinion (17 points and 10 points, respectively). In 15 countries surveyed, those on the ideological right are significantly more likely to say it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values (ideology is self-reported and varies by country). Across 34 countries, a median of 61% say that God plays an important role in their lives, compared with 53% who say that prayer is important in their daily life.

      " Global survey finds the world still believes in God “The Global God Divide” is the new report of the Pew Research Center that interviewed more than 38,000 people from 34 different countries in 2019. It is a deeply-rooted conviction in nations like Islamic Indonesia and the Catholic Philippines (96%), much less in Europe (22%), but still present in the United States (44%). Is the planet becoming secularised or not? And what importance does it attribute to God in daily life? In fact, despite the forecast – and perhaps the hopes – of some, the first fact that has emerged from this work is that the world still has faith, indeed it has a great deal of faith. Now, since those who openly declare the importance of religion and prayer are notoriously only a part of the total number of believers, what the Pew Research Center tells us is that the world today is not simply religious – it is very religious. Even with reference to those who declare that God is important in their lives, Italy is literally collapsing (down 21% from 1991 to 2019), while instead the countries of the former USSR are clearly recovering, like Russia (from 40 to 46%, +6), Bulgaria (from 41 to 55%, +14) and Ukraine (from 50 to 62%, +12).</p>\n",

Yet on all indicators it seems that there is a slight, almost unnoticeable, shift around the world towards more religion. Sample Size and Mode of Field Work: A total of 57 768 persons were interviewed globally. In 2014 and 2016, Africa and the Middle East stood out as most religious regions, according to people’s personal declarations. For further details see our website: www.gallup-international.com.
