       "\"\\nAmazon Deforestation — How Much of the Rainforest Is Left?  The truth sounds unbelievable, and certainly counterintuitive, when talking about what should be the planet’s lungs: animal agriculture, logging, mining, infrastructure and urban development caused some parts of the Amazon rainforest to emit more carbon dioxide than it absorbs in 2021. Deforestation in the Amazon has eliminated thousands of species of wildlife and plants, put the lives of local communities at risk and crippled one of nature’s most important tools in storing carbon and staving off the climate crisis.\\xa0According to the World Resources Institute, the Amazon rainforest remains a net carbon sink, just barely, and that’s thanks to strong protections in lands managed by Indigenous communities. Let’s take a look at how we got here, and what can be done to restore this crucial rainforest.\\xa0 The Amazon Rainforest Is a Critical Tool for Climate Action Not only does the rainforest provide a habitat for thousands of species of wildlife and millions of plant species, but it plays an important role in counteracting global climate change. By current estimates, the Amazon holds around 150 billion tons of carbon, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide emissions.  The Amazon Rainforest Spans Eight Countries The rainforest spans parts of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. Brazil contains the largest portion of this natural resource — just over 1.5 million square miles of the Amazon. Brazil is also where the majority of deforestation took place in 2021. How Big Is the Amazon Rainforest? The world’s most well-known rainforest covers approximately 2.72 million square miles in total, equivalent to twice the size of India. The Amazon river that flows through it is 4,100 miles long. How Much of the Amazon Rainforest Has Been Explored? Much of the Amazon rainforest remains unexplored — and its remoteness helps limit its destruction. In fact, the ancient ruins of vast cities were recently discovered in the midst of the forest.\\xa0 Native wildlife flora and fauna are still able to flourish in the most remote areas, and Indigenous people are able to remain isolated. Researchers believe there are still several dozen communities of Indigenous people in the Amazon who have never been in contact with researchers.\\xa0 When Did Deforestation Start in the Amazon? Researchers believe mass deforestation began in the 1960s, driven by land owners and their commercial activities. Why Is the Amazon Rainforest in Danger? Large swaths of the Amazon rainforest have been slashed and burned to be used for intensive animal agriculture, crop production, mining and industrial development. By 2018 these activities, among others, had resulted in the deforestation of 17 percent of the Amazon. In the past 20 years, eight percent of the rainforest has been destroyed as it continues to lose resilience. Cattle Ranching Cattle ranching is a leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon, accounting for around 80 percent of the destruction there, and the release of 340 million tons of carbon per year. The region has experienced an eight percent increase in cattle since 2020. Small-Scale Agriculture The cumulative effects of small-scale agriculture are also devastating the Amazon. Research suggests that an increase in the number of smaller-scale agriculture operations started across Amazonia between 2001 to 2014 are an effort by landowners to deforest while evading government monitoring systems. Agriculture Just like animal agriculture, crop production in the Amazon involves the clearing and burning of large areas of land. The crops grown on these areas of land include soy, sugar cane, palm oil, cotton and rice. Since soy is a key ingredient in animal feed, its demand is rising along with the global demand for meat. In addition to the issues caused by the clearing of such vast areas of the rainforest, agricultural practices such as the use of pesticides and fertilizers have implications for the native wildlife, plant species and Indigenous people of the region. Logging Logging, including illegal logging, is another major culprit when it comes to deforesting the Amazon. Scientists were especially alarmed when they learned that logging is moving deeper into the rainforest instead of staying on the periphery, where it is more easily tracked and monitored. Mining The Amazon region is often mined for gold, copper, iron, manganese and other materials. In order to mine these materials, landowners clear vast areas of forest in order to dig mining pits. Gold mining is on the rise in recent years and, in one area of the Amazon along the Guiana Shield, gold mining accounts for around 90 percent of deforestation. The process of mining gold has further ecological impacts due to its use of mercury, which can contaminate local water supplies. Climate Change Increasing deforestation rates impede the Amazon’s ability to store carbon and counter climate change. In 2021, it was discovered that due to deforestation, parts of the rainforest\\xa0started emitting more carbon than it held.\\xa0 Our changing climate is also having an impact on deforestation. As the forest becomes drier and contains less moisture, it becomes more susceptible to wildfires, which themselves cause critical damage to the environment and biodiversity. Infrastructure The development of road networks has made parts of the rainforest accessible that were previously difficult to reach. The majority of deforestation hotspots in Brazil in 2021 were found along major road networks. Lack of Sufficient Regulations When decision-makers have a simplistic pro-development agenda, they tend to have little regard for the devastating ecological and social impact of deforestation. Destructive activities surged in the Amazon after 2019, when president Bolsonaro’s government in Brazil weakened the protections that were previously put in place to protect the rainforest. Fortunately for the planet, with the election of a new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, efforts to combat illegal deforestation and protect the rainforest have increased.\\xa0Deforestation is now at a six-year low, in part as a result of those efforts. Lack of Law Enforcement The Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources was set up to monitor activities related to the conservation of natural resources in Brazil. In 2019 and 2020, however, the agency acted on only 1.3 percent of the alerts for illegal deforestation activity in Brazil. Estimates suggest 94 percent of deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado may involve illegal activity, or around 18 million hectares of habitat. Though Brazil’s new president is taking steps to remove cattle who are being kept illegally in the rainforest, ranchers, and even some politicians, are attempting to stop the operations.\\xa0 Fires Fires are often started deliberately in the Amazon to clear land for animal agriculture, crop production and other related activities. In addition to intentionally destroying thousands of hectares of the rainforest, fires can easily escape control.\\xa0 While the natural moisture of a rainforest should provide protection from the spread of fire, increasingly dry conditions can impede the rainforest’s ability to protect itself. Wildfires clear even more areas of land, and in turn, increase susceptibility to further fires. Impact on Indigenous People Deforestation is impacting millions of people who live in the Amazon, including Indigenous communities. While there has been much debate over how far pre-Columbian societies altered the landscape of the Amazon, one study published in 2021 suggests that native inhabitants of parts of northeastern Peru have lived there for thousands of years with very little impact on its ecosystem. Impacts on Water Supply Through a process known as transpiration, the Amazon expels large amounts of water into the atmosphere. This water then falls as rain, providing around half of the region’s rainfall. he health of the rainforest and its trees contributes to\\xa0 this process and helps to maintain a functioning water system. If too much of the Amazon is deforested, this natural balance is also in jeopardy.  Impact on Local Temperature With a reduction in the number of trees, the Amazon has less cover, contains and releases less moisture and can no longer cool the local climate in the way it once did.\\xa0 What Are the Solutions to Deforestation? In order to protect the Amazon rainforest, and thus ourselves, it’s necessary to take a multi-faceted approach that engages governments, NGOs, local and Indigenous communities, and nature itself.\\xa0 1. Increased Government Regulations Brazil’s previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, not only failed to enforce laws protecting the Amazon rainforest, but also cut the budgets of the government offices responsible for protecting it. Despite these moves, he did sign onto an international agreement to end deforestation.\\xa0 His successor, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has taken steps to meet those goals, and made protecting the Amazon a central part of his environmental platform.\\xa0 2. Implementing Nature-Based Solutions Amazon — the corporate giant, not the rainforest — launched a program in 2021 to support nature-based solutions in its namesake. They provide funding and technical support to small-scale farmers who opt to take part in sustainable, plant-based agriculture rather than expanding cattle operations. In exchange, the online marketplace receives carbon credits for the additional carbon being removed from the atmosphere and stored in the farmers’ trees.\\xa0Carbon credit programs, however, are only successful when the removals are real, additional, permanent and measurable; yet a recent investigation published in The Guardian revealed that 90 percent of certified rainforest credits were worthless.  3. Supporting Nonprofit Organizations There are numerous nonprofits involved with preserving and reforesting the Amazon rainforest. Some of the bigger names are The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International. There are also numerous smaller, locally run and organized groups. 4. Reducing or Eliminating Beef and Dairy Consumption Since cattle ranching and feed crop cultivation are the leading causes of deforestation in the Amazon, reducing or eliminating the amount of beef and dairy we consume is a key part of protecting the rainforest.\\xa0 5. Indigenous Land Management Indigenous peoples have lived alongside and stewarded the natural resources of the Amazon Rainforest for thousands of years. Under their watchful eye, the rainforest thrived, and they continue to advocate on the forest’s behalf.\\xa0 How Deforestation in the Amazon Affects Plant and Animal Species As one of the most biodiverse places on earth, the Amazon is home to thousands of different species. Its destruction has lasting implications for all who call it home. When the forest is destroyed, animals lose their homes and food chains are disrupted, leading to species extinctions.\\xa0 Almost 20 Percent of the Amazon Rainforest Has Been Destroyed Since the 1970s In just 50 years, almost 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest has been destroyed. Scientists warn that we’re dangerously close to the forest’s breaking point: 25 percent deforestation. At that point, the forest risks collapsing in on itself and transitioning to scrubby savannah.\\xa0 How Much of the Amazon Rainforest Is Left? Just over 80 percent of the\\xa0rainforest coverage measured in the 1970s still remains. Of that, scientists caution that 38 percent suffers from some sort of degradation.\\xa0Yet recently, much of the deforestation has been halted as a result of more protective environmental policies.  Initiatives To Combat Deforestation and Protect the Amazon Rainforest Environmental advocates are using a number of different tactics to protect and restore the Amazon rainforest. Some point to carbon credits to encourage corporations to invest in the forest’s protection whereas others are encouraging stronger public policy solutions, especially regulations that limit agricultural expansion. Still others take a more grassroots approach to bring attention to the issue and protect the forest.\\xa0 Economic Motivations Driving Deforestation The largest driver of deforestation in the Amazon is animal agriculture. Roughly 80 percent of the deforested land has been converted into pasture land for cattle. The country driving the trend is the United States, which in 2021 bought more than 320 million pounds of Brazilian beef.\\xa0 The Bottom Line The Amazon rainforest is one of the planet’s critical tools for staving off the climate crisis. Yet some parts of the forest have already started emitting more carbon than they absorb — a trend we can’t afford to perpetuate.\\xa0 Research suggests that reducing or eliminating consumption of beef; especially that from JBS, the largest Brazilian beef company, has the potential to halt global deforestation, including in the Amazon rainforest.

      " Amazon Deforestation — How Much of the Rainforest Is Left? The truth sounds unbelievable, and certainly counterintuitive, when talking about what should be the planet’s lungs: animal agriculture, logging, mining, infrastructure and urban development caused some parts of the Amazon rainforest to emit more carbon dioxide than it absorbs in 2021. According to the World Resources Institute, the Amazon rainforest remains a net carbon sink, just barely, and that’s thanks to strong protections in lands managed by Indigenous communities. Brazil is also where the majority of deforestation took place in 2021. How Much of the Amazon Rainforest Has Been Explored? Research suggests that an increase in the number of smaller-scale agriculture operations started across Amazonia between 2001 to 2014 are an effort by landowners to deforest while evading government monitoring systems. Mining The Amazon region is often mined for gold, copper, iron, manganese and other materials. As the forest becomes drier and contains less moisture, it becomes more susceptible to wildfires, which themselves cause critical damage to the environment and biodiversity. Deforestation is now at a six-year low, in part as a result of those efforts. This water then falls as rain, providing around half of the region’s rainfall. Increased Government Regulations Brazil’s previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, not only failed to enforce laws protecting the Amazon rainforest, but also cut the budgets of the government offices responsible for protecting it. There are also numerous smaller, locally run and organized groups.

      " The Amazon saw record deforestation last year. Last year, the Amazon saw some of the highest rates of deforestation in over a decade, due to a combination of cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects that cleared millions of acres of rainforest. An estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021 and the highest figure on record except for 2004, when over 2 million hectares (about 5 million acres) were lost. “ Satellite readings show that a lot of the forest loss is concentrated around roads, most notably the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the states of Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia and Acre. Fires also directly impacted another 106,922 hectares (264,210 acres). Peru is also struggling with a Mennonite problem in the central Amazon. And while that and gold mining have received the most attention from policymakers and conservationists, the data suggests that much of the 144,682 hectares (357,517 acres) lost last year in Peru actually came from small-scale agriculture. “ We really target those cases because they’re important, but then you still have this 90% that’s a slow death by a thousand cuts — the expansion that no one really has a handle on.” Now moving into 2023, there’s some concern that the El Niño warm front will exacerbate fires and increase forest loss for the year. We’re optimistic about things going down in Brazil with Lula,” Finer said. “\n",

The most strongly indicated actions encompass an urgent deforestation moratorium, supported by financial and human-resources investment in environmental monitoring and law enforcement, revision and strengthening of the PPCDAm, and a coherent plan for regularization and protection of public and indigenous lands.

      "Possible answers: It lost a total of 1.4 million hectares (3.45 million acres) of primary forest, making it the worst year of deforestation since a historic peak ...\n",
      "Extra details: <p>The Amazon saw record deforestation last year. Last year, the Amazon saw some of the highest rates of deforestation in over a decade, due to a combination of cattle ranching, agriculture, mining and road projects that cleared millions of acres of rainforest. An estimated 1.98 million hectares (4.89 million acres) of forest were cleared in 2022, a 21% increase from 2021 and the highest figure on record except for 2004, when over 2 million hectares (about 5 million acres) were lost. “ Satellite readings show that a lot of the forest loss is concentrated around roads, most notably the Trans-Amazonian Highway in the states of Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia and Acre. Fires also directly impacted another 106,922 hectares (264,210 acres). Peru is also struggling with a Mennonite problem in the central Amazon. And while that and gold mining have received the most attention from policymakers and conservationists, the data suggests that much of the 144,682 hectares (357,517 acres) lost last year in Peru actually came from small-scale agriculture. “ We really target those cases because they’re important, but then you still have this 90% that’s a slow death by a thousand cuts — the expansion that no one really has a handle on.” Now moving into 2023, there’s some concern that the El Niño warm front will exacerbate fires and increase forest loss for the year. We’re optimistic about things going down in Brazil with Lula,” Finer said. “</p>\n",

Did Kyle have a shot at winning the third round? I don't remember the exact score, but Kyle could have won the third round had he done a couple things differently. But I do believe in the fourth round, I think Kyle wouldn't have won a fourth round., And I think maybe even won the fight if there would have been a fifth round. And he was pressing forward, perhaps in a funny way that you could tell me I'm wrong, but it felt like he wasn't emphasizing head movement at that point. He went full Mike Tyson. There was a point at which, so it's funny that you say that. Which is a contradiction, actually, because., Mike Tyson had great head movement. I actually don't know exactly what I mean because he was in the pocket. I think he was trying to do the movement. He was just in the pocket and pressing forward. And the fuck you attitude of just not pressing down. That was a little bit later when Zabit's back was towards the cage. Towards the end of the round. We get that fight. And I said to Kyle, I was like,, look, this kid has been training martial arts since he was three years old. There's not an area where you're gonna out technique him. And so we've gotta now channel some of that grit that we know you have. This is an opportunity to showcase it. And I don't know how long I did it for, because Kyle's much shorter than Zabit. So for a good long while, while we were training for Zabit, I didn't even say anything. And I just had clips of Mike Tyson training, on the TV in the gym and the head movement. And I didn't even mention it. And then we started to like get into it and talk about getting inside the length of the longer fighter and things like that. And we kind of, which when some people train MMA, they say, okay, this guy's a really good wrestler. Let's think about avoiding the wrestling or being a better wrestler.\\n And I think that when the difference in skill is so great, those are both the wrong answer. If a guy who's a really good wrestler wants to take you down and you don't have a lot of wrestling experience, he's probably gonna get you down if he's got a good coach, right? So you have to deal with that. To then say, I'm gonna then learn in eight weeks how to wrestle better than a guy who's been wrestling since he was eight years old is also a bad idea.\""

We understand DNA and we understand fundamental particles. We didn't start that way a thousand years ago., And we haven't evolved biologically very much, but somehow our minds are able to extend. And therefore AI can be seen also as one such step that we created and it's our tool. And it's part of that meme evolution that we created, even if our biological evolution does not progress as fast. And us humans might only be able to understand so much., We're keeping up so far, or we think we're keeping up so far, but we might need AI systems to understand. Maybe like the physics of the universe is operating, look at strength theory. Maybe it's operating in much higher dimensions. Maybe we're totally, because of our cognitive limitations, are not able to truly internalize the way this world works., And so we're running up against the limitation of our own minds. And we have to create these next level organisms like AI systems that would be able to understand much deeper, like really understand what it means to live in a multi dimensional world that's outside of the four dimensions, the three of space and one of time. Translation, and generally we can deal with the world,\\n even if you don't understand all the details, we can use computers, even though we don't, most of us don't know all the structure that's underneath or drive a car. I mean, there are many components, especially new cars that you don't quite fully know, but you have the interface, you have an abstraction of it that allows you to operate it and utilize it. And I think that that's perfectly adequate and we can build on it.\""

And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy entering this huge library for the first time, being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance, and beauty of this library, but all he could do was read the first page of the first volume., Well, that library is the universe, with all sorts of mysterious, magical things that we have yet to find. And then Galileo was asked about this. Galileo said that the purpose of science, the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go. The purpose of religion is to determine, how to go to heaven. So in other words, science is about natural law, and religion is about ethics, how to be a good person, how to go to heaven. As long as we keep these two things apart, we're in great shape. The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences begin to pontificate about ethics,, and people from religion begin to pontificate about natural law. That's where we get into big trouble. You think they're fundamentally distinct, morality and ethics and our idea of what is right and what is wrong. That's something that's outside the reach of string theory and physics. That's right., If you talk to a squirrel about what is right and what is wrong, there's no reference frame for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space, if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us like we talk to squirrels in the forest, but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels\\n because they don't talk back to us. Same thing with aliens from outer space. They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us to a degree, but after a while they just get bored because we have nothing to offer them. So our sense of right and wrong, what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense of right and wrong? Now we of course do have an ethics\""

So I start not to have the money to send to her. And I'm like, so she calls, and she's like, look,, I have to have money. And I was like, well, look, I'm doing what I can. You promised money. And I was like, look, if you knew what I was doing to get this money, you wouldn't be asking that. And she's like, I need money. My rent's behind by a month right now. And I'm like, your rent's behind? She's like, yeah. So I was like, OK, so I pick up the phone, call the rental office., And I was like, I just want to make sure that I'm sorry I'm behind on the rent for this apartment number. Oh, no, that rent's paid up three months. It's like, OK, hang up, call Elizabeth back. I was like, you're behind on the rent. And she was like, yeah. And I was like, funny, they just said you're up on it three months. And she gets quiet, and she's like, well, you lied to me, too., And I was like, you're right. I did. I did that. I was like, but look, I can't do it anymore. And that's the last time I spoke to her right there. What happens is I was breaking law from inside the offices. I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles., I had taught him how to do tax return fraud. I had told Sean, I go missing, I go missing for three months. I told him if I ever went missing not to contact me. And so I go missing, then I show back up online. First day, he contacts. So he becomes a target. And they identify him pretty quickly at that point. He's set to be arrested sometime in March of six.\n",

Porcelain tile is typically mid-range in price, costing an average of $12–$40 per square foot. These tiles are known for their glossy finish and smooth texture, but are also incredibly durable, withstanding scratches and water damage well compared to other tile types. Beyond materials and location, labor-related considerations such as individual tile size, subfloor repair or installation, and do-it-yourself (DIY) versus professional installation will also affect cost.

Ultimately, the price of marble flooring will vary based on the marble type and color, special design elements, local labor rates, and whether you go with marble tiles or slabs. This marble resembles Carrara’s base but has more dark gray veining and a warmer tone. In general, the more complicated the pattern, the more materials you may need to purchase and the higher the labor cost will be.

      " Sir Michael Philip Jagger (born 26 July 1943) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Richards' guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones' trademark throughout the band's career. According to a February 1985 article in Rolling Stone, Jagger did so to \"establish an artistic identity for himself apart from the Rolling Stones\" which was described as \"his boldest attempt yet\".[100] Jagger started writing and recording material for his first solo album She's the Boss.[100] Released on 19 February 1985,[101] the album, produced by Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell, features Herbie Hancock, Jeff Beck, Jan Hammer, Pete Townshend and the Compass Point All Stars. This led to a feud between Jagger and Richards that has been referred to as \"World War III\" with concern at the time that Jagger touring without the Stones could prove a \"death sentence\" for the band.[104] When the Stones released Dirty Work in March 1986, Jagger's relations with Richards had reached an all-time low, leading Jagger to refuse to tour with the band to support the new album. After multiple phone calls and deliberation, the other members of the group were decided upon.[139] SuperHeavy released one album[140] and two singles in 2011,[141] reportedly recording 29 songs in ten days.[142] Jagger is featured on will.i.am's 2011 single \"T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)\" along with Jennifer Lopez, officially released to iTunes on 4 February 2012.[143]\n",
      " On 21 February 2012, Jagger, B.B. King, Buddy Guy and Jeff Beck, and a blues ensemble, performed at the White House concert series before President Barack Obama. The programme, which first aired in the US on ABC on 22 November, coincided with the release of his fourth solo album, Goddess in the Doorway.[215][216] In 2008 the company began work on The Women, an adaptation of the George Cukor's film of the same name, directed by Diane English.[217][218]\n",
      " As a member of the Rolling Stones Jagger appears in several documentaries, including Gimme Shelter, filmed during the band's 1969 tour of the US, and Sympathy for the Devil (1968) directed by French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard. He also co-produced the James Brown biopic Get On Up (2014).[221] Alongside Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen and Terence Winter, Jagger co-created and executive produced the period drama series Vinyl (2016), which starred Bobby Cannavale and aired for one season on HBO before its cancellation.[222] Jagger portrays an English art dealer-collector and patron in Giuseppe Capotondi's thriller The Burnt Orange Heresy (2020).[223][224]\n",

And that we can switch that from vision to some other wavelength or some other kind of modality. But I think that the same processing principles probably still apply. But also indeed this ability to have information, more accessible and more relevant, I think can enhance what we do. I mean, kids today at school, they learn about DNA. I mean, things that were discovered just a couple of years ago. And it's already common knowledge and we are building on it. And we don't see a problem where there's too much information that we can absorb and learn., Maybe people become a little bit more narrow in what they know, they are in one field. But this information that we have accumulated, it is passed on and people are picking up on it and they are building on it. So it's not like we have reached the point of saturation. We have still this process that allows us to be selective and decide what's interesting, I think still works, even with the more information we have today. Yeah, it's fascinating to think about like Wikipedia becoming a sensor. Like, so the fire hose of information from Wikipedia. So it's like you integrated directly into the brain to where you're thinking, like you're observing the world with all of Wikipedia directly piping into your brain.

      " The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdalae and the hippocampi, the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia, the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins.[60] The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities of the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull.[61] Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves.[80] The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements.[82] Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.[83]\n",

These are considered scientifically discredited.[26][29]\n",

Overall white matter volume does not appear to decline with age, although there is variation between brain regions.[40]\n",
      " Genetic contribution[edit] Adult twin studies have indicated high heritability estimates for overall brain size in adulthood (between 66% and 97%). It is also well known that crows, ravens, and grey parrots are quite intelligent even though they have small brains. While humans have the largest encephalization quotient of extant animals, it is not out of line for a primate.[62][63] Some other anatomical trends are correlated in the human evolutionary path with brain size: the basicranium becomes more flexed with increasing brain size relative to basicranial length.[64]\n",

      "\"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information\"[1] is one of the most highly cited papers in psychology.[2][3][4] It was written by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Harvard University's Department of Psychology and published in 1956 in Psychological Review. In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (e.g., 10 different tones varying only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned before). The second cognitive limitation Miller discusses is memory span. Miller recognized that the correspondence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and of short-term memory span was only a coincidence, because only the first limit, not the second, can be characterized in information-theoretic terms (i.e., as a roughly constant number of bits). The number of chunks a human can recall immediately after presentation depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span is around seven for digits, around six for letters, and around five for words), and even on features of the chunks within a category. For instance, span depends on the lexical status of the contents (i.e., whether the contents are words known to the person or not).[12] Several other factors also affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks.

This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash. In the cognitive area, it is worth noting that the brain's prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes.

The \"N1\" implant, a little larger than a US quarter, is designed to replace a chunk of skull in the recipient, such that it's invisible under the skin. Insertion Hardware team lead Christine Odabashian talked through the process of getting a Neuralink implant installed – a process the company hopes will allow a single neurosurgeon to run several operations at once, handling the skin, skull, protective dura layer and other mechanical tasks while letting the R1 robot do all the needlework into the actual brain. \" A neurosurgeon would probably not like it very much if we asked them to do this ... There's not that many neurosurgeons. Unsurprisingly, there's no page in the machinery's handbook for this kind of thing, so we dug into the science of femtosecond laser ablation, and figured out a workflow that allows us to use our laser mill much like a CNC mill,\" said needle manufacturing and design team lead Sam Schmitz. \" It's trained implanted monkeys to move their gaze in the direction of a flashing light in exchange for dollops of banana smoothie, and then started replacing real flashing lights with brain signals sent through the Neuralink implant. Putting those two loops together, we have motor intention decoded from the brain, used to stimulate the spinal cord, causing movement, and then the sensory consequences of those actions, being recorded in the spinal cord, to stimulate the brain, causing perception,\" said Neuralink's Head of Next-Gen Joseph O'Doherty. \"</p>\n",

And that we can switch that from vision to some other wavelength or some other kind of modality. But I think that the same processing principles probably still apply. But also indeed this ability to have information, more accessible and more relevant, I think can enhance what we do. I mean, kids today at school, they learn about DNA. I mean, things that were discovered just a couple of years ago. And it's already common knowledge and we are building on it. And we don't see a problem where there's too much information that we can absorb and learn., Maybe people become a little bit more narrow in what they know, they are in one field. But this information that we have accumulated, it is passed on and people are picking up on it and they are building on it. So it's not like we have reached the point of saturation. We have still this process that allows us to be selective and decide what's interesting, I think still works, even with the more information we have today. Yeah, it's fascinating to think about like Wikipedia becoming a sensor. Like, so the fire hose of information from Wikipedia. So it's like you integrated directly into the brain to where you're thinking, like you're observing the world with all of Wikipedia directly piping into your brain. So like when I see a light,, I immediately have like the history of who invented electricity, like integrated very quickly into.

      " The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdalae and the hippocampi, the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia, the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins.[60] The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities of the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull.[61] Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves.[80] The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements.[82] Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.[83]\n",
      " Sensory[edit] The sensory nervous system is involved with the reception and processing of sensory information. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.[96]\n",
      " The lateral hypothalamus contains orexinergic neurons that control appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system.[97][98] The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through the release of peptides such as oxytocin, and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence. A key source of information about the function of brain regions is the effects of damage to them.[160]\n",
      " Advances in neuroimaging have enabled objective insights into mental disorders, leading to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and better monitoring.[161]\n",
      " Gene and protein expression[edit] Bioinformatics is a field of study that includes the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, that can be used in studies of the human brain, particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression. This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission, and subsequent cognitive decline and disease.[169][170]\n",

      "Summarized Page: <p>Contents Brain size The size of the brain is a frequent topic of study within the fields of anatomy, biological anthropology, animal science and evolution. Variation and evolution[edit] From early primates to hominids and finally to Homo sapiens, the brain is progressively larger, with exception of extinct Neanderthals whose brain size exceeded modern Homo sapiens. These are considered scientifically discredited.[26][29]\n",
      " A large-scale 1984 survey of global variation in skulls has concluded that variation in skull and head sizes is unrelated to race, but rather climatic heat preservation, stating \"We find little support for the use of brain size in taxonomic assessment (other than with paleontological extremes over time). Overall white matter volume does not appear to decline with age, although there is variation between brain regions.[40]\n",
      " Genetic contribution[edit] Adult twin studies have indicated high heritability estimates for overall brain size in adulthood (between 66% and 97%). It is also well known that crows, ravens, and grey parrots are quite intelligent even though they have small brains. While humans have the largest encephalization quotient of extant animals, it is not out of line for a primate.[62][63] Some other anatomical trends are correlated in the human evolutionary path with brain size: the basicranium becomes more flexed with increasing brain size relative to basicranial length.[64]\n",
      " Cranial capacity[edit] Cranial capacity is a measure of the volume of the interior of the skull of those vertebrates who have a brain. It compares the size of the brain of the specimen to the expected brain size of animals with roughly the same weight.[75] This way a more objective judgement can be made on the cranial capacity of an individual animal.</p>\n",

The implication here is that—with an information conservation law as the cornerstone—our model is not limited to brain regions, but can be applied to any neuronal system that has the attributes of information processing and storage capability. In this case, we have and \\(x(t) = \\frac{{H_{p} (t)}}{p}\\); it then follows that the neuronal activity of an individual brain region can be modeled as: This furnishes a first-order linear differential equation that connects the neuronal activity of a brain region with its information processing, storage capacities and the information arrival rate. Note that generally, the processing capability—associated with a particular cognitive task—does not change over a short time, and therefore for a given age group (either young or old group), it is reasonable to assume that the information processing capacity \\(p\\) is a constant and does not differ between the Congruent and Incongruent conditions during the experiment. The impulse response function (IRF) at each voxel with respect to each stimulus condition was resolved with multiple linear regression using the “3dDeconvolve” software in AFNI57 In the “3dDeconvolve” procedure, MRI signal modeling included subject motion regressors in the three translational and the three rotational directions, and the constant, linear and quadratic trends for each of the four functional runs. https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00190.2004 (2004).

      "                  Our brains have an upper limit on how much they can process at once due to a constant but limited energy supply, according to a new UCL study using a brain imaging method that measures cellular metabolism. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that paying attention can change how the brain allocates its limited energy; as the brain uses more energy in processing what we attend to, less energy is supplied to processing outside our attention focus. This explains why we experience inattentional blindness and deafness even to critical information that we really want to be aware of.” Co-author Professor Ilias Tachtsidis (UCL Medical Physics & Biomedical Engineering) said: “By using our in-house developed broadband near-infrared spectroscopy, an optical brain monitoring technology we developed at UCL, we were better able to measure an enzyme in the mitochondria (the power factory of the cells) that plays an integral part in metabolism.” “During recent months, we’ve heard from a lot of people who say they’re feeling overwhelmed, with constant news updates and new challenges to overcome. When your brain is at capacity, you are likely to fail to process some information. The study was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council, Toyota Motor Europe, and Wellcome.</p>\n",

Let us understand the phrases “megabytes” and “gigabytes”, which will help us know the storage capacity we look for when we buy any new gadget. The human brain is an intricate organ that manages memory, emotion, thoughts, touch, vision, breathing patterns, and every procedure that controls the human body. The cerebral cortex in the human brain is proficient in possessing 125 trillion synapses, which may stock as much as 2.5 petabytes of overall memory capacity. Each neuron comprises thousands of synapses, and the information a brain store is determined by the strength of networks between neurons, which is inclined by the size of synapses.
