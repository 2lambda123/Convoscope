But if you actually keep an open mind, you have to understand what is the way that intelligence agencies function? Is it possible to the head of an intelligence agency not to make direct orders of that kind, where there's a distributed No, the head of the intelligence agency would most likely give the order. Even though it's compartmentalized. Yeah, but, but, uh, but not the head of state. Not maybe not the head of state, although, uh, in the case, this is the case in the United States as well, but certainly is the case in Russia.

And so it's not a pure victory., And there's a lot of people that criticize the overreach of government and all of this. That one of the things that makes the United States great is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates. Even if the mandates on mass will have a positive, even strongly positive result,, many Americans will still say no. Because in the long arc of history, saying no in that moment will actually lead to a better country and a better world. So that's a messed up aspect of America, but it's also a beautiful part., We're skeptical even about good things. I agree and certainly we should all be cautious about government overreach, absolutely. And it happens in all kinds of scenarios with incarceration with a thousand things. And we also should be afraid of government underreach, that if there is a problem that could be solved by governments and that's why we have governments in the first place is that there's just certain things that individuals can't do on their own. And that's why we pool our resources and we, in some ways, sacrifice our rights for this common thing. And that's why we don't have, hopefully, people, murderers marauding\\n or people driving 200 miles down the street. We have a process for arriving at a set of common rules.

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: The conversation revolves around the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the potential for other solutions, the concept of government overreach, and the role of individualism in American society. The participants also touch on the balance between individual rights and collective safety, and the role of government in maintaining this balance. The mention of ivermectin suggests a discussion on alternative treatments for COVID-19. An insightful addition to this conversation could be a comparison of the effectiveness of vaccines versus alternative treatments like ivermectin, or a statistical analysis of the impact of individualism on public health measures. \n",
